This project aims to analyze online conversations by revealing not only sentiment but also the relationships between key entities. While traditional sentiment analysis offers insights into public opinion, it often fails to capture the connections between people, locations, and other elements of discourse. Our approach fills this gap by identifying named entities and analyzing the structure of conversations, allowing us to construct a network of relationships. This methodology enhances the understanding of how entities are connected and provides a more nuanced view of online discussions.
